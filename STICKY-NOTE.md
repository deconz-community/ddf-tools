# Idea

Maybe split the store UI out of the toolbox.
This will need to split the vue component in a new package
But I won't be able to have an install button from the store page

Create a package for the API definition of the store to share type definition or just a global type package for all packages

Add a note for the frimware version of the 2 DDF of TRADFRI on/off switch
